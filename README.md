Thank you for pointing that out! Since your project doesn’t include Python execution or CLI simulation as originally stated, I’ll **remove all Python references** and give you the **correct, clean, complete `README.md` content**, purely focused on the **web-based HTML/CSS/JS implementation**.

Here's the finalized Markdown text for your GitHub README:

# 🧠 CPU Scheduling Algorithms Simulator

A **browser-based simulator** for various **CPU Scheduling Algorithms**, including:

- **First-Come-First-Serve (FCFS)**
- **Shortest Job First (SJF)** (Preemptive & Non-Preemptive)
- **Round Robin**
- **Priority Scheduling**

The project features a dynamic **Gantt Chart UI** that visualizes the execution of these scheduling algorithms. Users input process details such as **arrival time**, **burst time**, and **priority** (if applicable). The system then calculates and displays key metrics:

- **Waiting Time**
- **Turnaround Time**
- **Completion Time**

Gantt Charts are color-coded by process, with an interactive timeline showing execution order, start, and end times. Hovering over a process reveals detailed data. Below the chart, a process table presents the scheduling results, and additional graphical comparisons display performance metrics across algorithms for an intuitive and analytical experience.

✅ **Perfect for Operating Systems coursework and CPU scheduling algorithm visualization.**

## 🚀 Features

- 🟦 FCFS, SJF, Round Robin, Priority Scheduling  
- 🔁 Preemptive + Non-Preemptive Support (SJF)  
- 📊 Gantt Chart Visualization (HTML + JavaScript)  
- 🔤 Interactive Input via Web Interface  
- 📈 Average Waiting & Turnaround Time Calculation  
- 🎨 Clean Frontend Styling via Bootstrap

## 🌐 Web Interface

**To use the simulator:**

```bash
Open `index.html` in your browser
````

**The interface uses:**

* **HTML/CSS/JavaScript**
* `style.css`, `cpu-scheduler.css`, `docs.html`, `explanation.css`, `ganttcharts.html`
* `cpu-scheduler.js`, `MathJaxSetup.js`, `new.js`
* **Bootstrap** for responsive layout and styling
